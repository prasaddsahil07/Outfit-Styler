FUTURE SCOPE:
We need to take care of location and integrate it with temperature as a L2 vacation destination.
OTT use cases like destination weddings and related styling.
We can incorporate the user body profile data so that the generated model can match the user's look.
Using mannequins/models is useful, it takes care of the multiple combo issue.
Instead of random models, can't we use actual person as a model.
Pop up notification to upload more images in digital wardrobe(once they logged in and don't have sufficient items in wardrobe , say < 10)
